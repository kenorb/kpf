Repaired the javascript source selector.
Added 'file' method for providing source data. This will allow features or any module to bundle and distribute a vocab.
Moved the guts of taxonomy_xml_import_form_submit into taxonomy_xml_fetch_and_import so it can be called from code better.
Renamed 'source_selector' on the edit form to be 'protocol' for better labels in features arrays.
Renamed services 'servicename' to just 'name' so we can create named vocabs easier
CSV data is now allowed to be a super-simple one column list of term names
Updates to the 'Features' import.
Added a cheat to prevent features from detecting already-imported taxa as 'overridden'.
