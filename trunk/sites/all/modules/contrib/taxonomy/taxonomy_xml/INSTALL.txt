== Configuration ==

To use this module, you install and enable it in admin/modules.
Taxonomy_xml functions are available to users who have the access
right to "administer taxonomy." (User access rights can be set from
admin/user/configure/permission.)

New options will become available under
/admin/content/taxonomy/import
/admin/content/taxonomy/export

== Installation (semi-optional) ==

The RDF format functions require the download and install of the ARC parser.
http://arc.semsol.org/

This can be installed EITHER :
  in a subdirectory of this module as
  modules/taxonomy_xml/arc
  so the file
  modules/taxonomy_xml/arc/ARC_rdfxml_parser.php
  ... and others are available there
OR
  by using the libraries.module
  http://drupal.org/project/libraries
  and installing arc in
  sites/all/libraries/arc

== Installation (semi-optional 2) ==

To import huge remote vocabularies, structure support is only possible
if the system records a GUID (usually a URI) 
so we can match local terms against remote identifiers.

Without this support, recursion will be disabled.

This requires that you use the taxonomy_guid (Easy) 
or taxonomy_enhancer (some assembly required)
or rdf module
http://drupal.org/project/rdf
and more, as described in help/rdf.html
